This assignment is to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). It generates the best tours and cost and stops when there are no better tours to be found.

The code is written in C++ and the algorithm used is Christofides algorithm. A detailed report about the algorithm is also available in the project for reference.

The code needs to be compiled using any C++ compiler and the Makefile for the same has been made available.

For execution, we simply need to invoke run file.
