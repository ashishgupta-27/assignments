This assignment was to implement Alpha - Beta pruning on a Game Tree.

The Game tree GUI developed in Python was 4-ply tree in which nodes act as positions in a game and edges as moves. On top of that, Alpha-beta pruning algorithm was implemented. The optimized path was highlighted once detected.

The following packages needs to be installed:
1. PyQt5
2. pickle
3. numpy
4. scipy

The code can be executed with the following command:
python TreeCode.py
