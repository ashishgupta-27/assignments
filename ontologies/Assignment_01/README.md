In this assignment, we were told to identify a domain or system of interest. This should exist in the real world and we need to define the concepts and entities in the domain using description logic.

So, the domain that we have used is the events and activities management system in an educational institute(particularly IITM). We have defined T-Boxes and A-Boxes using SROIQ description logic.

This was a group assignment where the group had 5 members.
